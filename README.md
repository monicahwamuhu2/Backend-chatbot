# **Chatbot Backend**

This is the backend for the chatbot application, built using **FastAPI**, a modern and fast web framework for building APIs with Python. The backend handles incoming requests from the frontend, processes the user's message, generates a bot response (which could be based on a predefined set of rules or an AI model), and returns the response to the frontend. This backend is hosted on **Railway** for easy deployment and scaling.

---

### **Tech Stack**

- **FastAPI**: A high-performance web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints. It is fast, easy to use, and designed for building REST APIs.
- **Uvicorn**: An ASGI server that serves FastAPI applications. It's an asynchronous server that is incredibly fast and allows FastAPI to handle multiple requests concurrently.
- **Python 3.9+**: A modern version of Python that provides a wide array of libraries and features, perfect for building high-performance web applications.
- **Pydantic**: A data validation library used by FastAPI to validate incoming request data and ensure that it meets the expected format.
- **Railway**: A cloud platform for quickly deploying and managing backend applications. It handles the server infrastructure and scaling automatically.

### **Features**

- **Handles POST requests**: The backend listens for POST requests containing the user's message (in the form of JSON) and processes them.
- **Processes User Input**: The backend processes the user's input, which can be done either by rule-based logic or by calling an AI model to generate a bot response.
- **Generates Bot Response**: After processing the input, the backend generates an appropriate response from the bot and sends it back to the frontend.
- **RESTful API**: The backend provides a clean, easy-to-use API for interacting with the chatbot.
- **Deployment on Railway**: The backend is deployed on Railway, which simplifies the deployment process and makes scaling the application easy.

### **Installation**

To set up the chatbot backend on your local machine, follow the steps below:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   First, open your terminal or command prompt and clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/chatbot-backend.git
   cd chatbot-backend
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)**:

   It is a good practice to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies in Python. To create and activate a virtual environment:

   - On macOS/Linux:

     ```bash
     python3 -m venv venv
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

   - On Windows:

     ```bash
     python -m venv venv
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

   Once the virtual environment is activated, any Python packages you install will be contained within it.

3. **Install dependencies**:

   Next, you need to install the necessary dependencies. The required packages are listed in the `requirements.txt` file, so use the following command:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   This will install FastAPI, Uvicorn, and any other dependencies required to run the backend.

4. **Set up your environment variables**:

   You can configure environment variables such as database connections or secret keys. Here's how to set them up:

   - In the root directory of the project, create a `.env` file to store your environment variables.
   
   - Example `.env` file:

     ```bash
     DATABASE_URL="your-database-url"
     ```

     Add any other variables you need for your backend here.

5. **Run the backend server locally**:

   After setting up your environment, you can start the FastAPI backend by running the following command:

   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

   The `--reload` flag makes the server automatically restart if you make any changes to the code.

6. **Open the app in your browser**:

   Once the backend server is running, you can access it in your browser at the following URL:

   ```bash
   http://localhost:8000
   ```

   This will open the FastAPI documentation (Swagger UI) where you can interact with the API and test the endpoints.

### **Deployment on Railway**

After youâ€™ve set up and tested the backend locally, itâ€™s time to deploy it to **Railway**.

1. **Push the code to your repository**:

   Before deploying, ensure that all your changes are committed to your GitHub (or other Git repositories) and pushed.

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Create a new Railway project**:

   - Go to the [Railway dashboard](https://railway.app/) and log in (or create an account if you donâ€™t have one).
   - Create a new project and choose the **GitHub repository** that contains your chatbot backend code.
   - Railway will automatically detect your FastAPI project and configure the necessary deployment environment.

3. **Set environment variables on Railway (if needed)**:

   If your application requires any environment variables (such as database URLs, secret keys, etc.), you can add them in the Railway dashboard.

   - Navigate to your project settings on Railway.
   - Go to **Settings > Environment Variables** and add the necessary variables. For example:

     ```bash
     DATABASE_URL="your-database-url"
     ```

4. **Deploy the backend**:

   Railway will automatically detect changes in the repository and deploy the app when you push new commits. It will also provide you with a URL where your backend is live.

### **API Endpoints**

Here are the main API endpoints that the backend provides:

1. **POST /chat**: This endpoint receives a user's message and returns a bot response.

   - **Request Example**:
     ```json
     {
       "text": "Hi, how are you?"
     }
     ```

   - **Response Example**:
     ```json
     {
       "response": "I am just a bot! ðŸ˜Š"
     }
     ```

   The `text` field in the request is the message sent by the user. The backend processes this input and returns the bot's response in the `response` field.

---

### **Troubleshooting**

If you encounter issues while running the backend or deploying it, here are some things to check:

1. **Ensure the backend server is running**:

   Make sure that the backend server is up and running locally or on Railway. You can check the status of the server by going to `http://localhost:8000` or reviewing the Railway dashboard logs.

2. **Check the Railway logs**:

   If the backend is not responding as expected, check the logs in the Railway dashboard. The logs can provide detailed information about errors or failed deployments.

3. **Ensure that the frontend is using the correct backend URL**:

   Double-check that the frontend is using the correct backend URL by verifying the environment variable in the frontend project. The variable `NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL` should point to the correct Railway URL where your backend is deployed.

4. **Database and External Dependencies**:

   If your backend uses a database or external services, ensure that those services are correctly set up and accessible from the backend. This includes checking if the database URL or API keys are correctly configured.
